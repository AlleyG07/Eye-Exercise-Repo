# Eye See Double
<h4>Move with the Mouse<h4>

Description: Create a second eye in addition to the other eye that is there. This eye must also follow the mouse in any position that it moves just like the starter eye on the screen.
  
How to Run: There are starter files that include an index.html, eyes.js and styles.css files. These files should assist you with binding some popular mouse events to the DOM elements in this project. The second eye should be added and have the exact same functions as the first eye.
  
Roadmap of Future Improvements: In the future, I would like to have fun with the project and create a mulieyed monster. I would like to see if I can keep the same concept but change the different sizes of the eyes. I may have the odd eyes go in one direction and have the even eyes go in a different direction and see how it works out. Furthermore, I would like to color the odd eyes blue and the even eyes gold.
